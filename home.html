        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I wasn't originally interested in photography. First I was interested in 
        drawing and painting, but it was so hard for me to find the reference photos
        of what I needed. So I started taking my own photos. I started in figures and 
        portriates in order to get the positioning right for my own art pieces but I
        soon expanded into landscapes from there. I became facinated with the world
        around me and wanted to preserve and then hopefully share that with those around
        me.</p>
